<p style="margin-top:85px;">The 15 September 2020 W3C Process Document and 15 September 2020 W3C Patent Policy take effect today.
At a time when the Web is increasingly essential with the world
going more and more virtual,these updates increase the Web Consortium’s responsiveness
and strengthen standardization activities by adding a continuous standard development mode
and earlier Royalty-Free protection for implementers, among other changes. Please read more in our press release.
</p>
<p>
These critical improvements required an important change to the W3C Patent Policy
the first major update to this groundbreaking document since its introduction
to the world in 2005 to provide patent protection at earlier Candidate phases,
supporting unencumbered implementation and use even as specifications continue to evolve.
This change helps to de-risk Web experimentation and reinforce access
to the Web’s technology as common infrastructure.</p>
